# Logbook - Customer Management System

Logbook is a modern customer management system designed to help businesses efficiently manage and track their customer information. It's built as a full-stack web application, meaning it has a separate backend (server-side) and frontend (client-side) that work together. The backend is powered by FastAPI, a high-performance Python framework, while the frontend is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Key Features

Customer Management: It provides a centralized place to add, view, and manage customer details, including their name, phone number, the amount they owe, and their current payment status.

Search Functionality: You can easily search for specific customers, making it simple to find information quickly.

Payment Tracking: The system allows you to track the payment status of each customer, which is essential for managing accounts receivable.

Transaction and Audit Logging: It automatically logs all transactions and maintains an audit trail. This means every action, such as adding a new customer or updating their details, is recorded, providing a clear history of changes for accountability and security.

Responsive UI: The user interface (UI) is designed to be responsive, which means it will adapt and look good on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technical Requirements and Setup

To run Logbook, you'll need to set up the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.8+: This is required for the FastAPI backend.
- Node.js 16+: This is needed to run the React frontend.
- PostgreSQL: The project uses a PostgreSQL database to store all customer and transaction data.

The README provides detailed instructions for setting up the database and starting both the backend and frontend servers, which involves installing dependencies and running specific commands in the project's directories.

## API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend exposes several API endpoints to handle data requests from the frontend. The main endpoint for adding a new customer requires specific fields:

- name: The customer's full name.
- phone: Their contact phone number.
- amount: The amount they owe.
- paid_status: A boolean value (true or false) to indicate if the payment has been made.

These endpoints are what allow the frontend and backend to communicate and perform actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting customer information.

## Troubleshooting

The README includes a section to help with common issues, such as:

- Database connection errors: Tips for ensuring your PostgreSQL database is running and configured correctly.
- Port conflicts: Advice on what to do if another application is already using the ports required by the backend or frontend servers.
- This information helps users quickly resolve common problems they might encounter during setup.

# For Developers -

A modern customer management system built with FastAPI (Python) backend and React frontend.

## Features

- Add and manage customers with name, phone, amount, and payment status
- Track customer information (name, phone, amount, status, credit limit, etc.)
- Search functionality across all customer fields
- Payment status tracking (yet to pay, processing, paid)
- Transaction logging
- Audit trail for all changes
- Modern, responsive UI

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL database

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

First, create a PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE logbook;
```

You can use the provided `logbook.sql` file to create the tables, or the application will create them automatically.

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables (optional):
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/logbook"
```

4. Run the backend server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Health check
- `GET /customers/` - Get all customers
- `GET /customers/search/?q={query}` - Search customers across all fields
- `POST /customers/` - Create a new customer
- `POST /transactions/` - Add a new transaction

## Customer Fields

The customer creation endpoint accepts the following fields:

- **name** (required): Customer's full name
- **phone** (optional): Customer's phone number
- **amount** (optional): Customer's amount/balance (numeric value)
- **status** (required): Payment status - "yet to pay", "processing", or "paid"
- **upi_vpa** (optional): UPI Virtual Payment Address
- **credit_limit** (optional): Customer's credit limit
- **billing_cycle_day** (optional): Day of month for billing cycle

```

## Development

- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Frontend: React with Vite
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Styling: Custom CSS with modern design

## Troubleshooting

1. **Database Connection Error**: Make sure PostgreSQL is running and the database exists
2. **Port Already in Use**: Change ports in `main.py` (backend) or `vite.config.js` (frontend)
3. **CORS Issues**: The backend is configured to allow requests from localhost:3000 and localhost:5173

### Port Conflicts

If you encounter "port already in use" errors, you can kill processes using these ports:

**Kill process on port 8000 (Backend):**
```bash
lsof -ti:8000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || echo "No process on port 8000"
```

**Kill process on port 3000 (Frontend):**
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || echo "No process on port 3000"
```

These commands will forcefully terminate any processes running on the specified ports, allowing you to restart your servers.

### Database Migration

If you're upgrading from an older version and need to add the amount and status fields to existing customers table:

```bash
# The application will automatically create the amount and status columns
# If you need to manually add them:
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN amount NUMERIC(10, 2);
ALTER TABLE customers ADD COLUMN status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'yet to pay' CHECK (status IN ('yet to pay', 'processing', 'paid'));
```
